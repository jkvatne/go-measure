# Go software for automated measurements 

Copyright Jan KÃ¥re Vatne, 2020

This package implements interfaces for different multimeters, oscilloscopes and power supplies.
It is independent of National instruments drivers or other software. The only non-google imports
are the serial library, which is my own fork of github.com/tarm/serial, with some modifications,
and the small logger project on github.com/jkvatne/alog

It is is developed for Windows 10, but all tcp/ip and serial interfaces should work on Linux.
The only exception is the Digilent Analog Discovery 2, which uses a binary library. But this
is also available in Linux, so it should be possible to implement a Linux version.

NB: This is a work in progress, and things may change dramatically when new functions are added.

Instruments support will be extended later. The following are currently supported:

### Multimeters
* Fluke 8845A

### Power supplies
* TTi CPX400
* Korad KD3005
* Manual controlled supply

### Oscilloscopes
* Tektronix TDS2000 series

### Multifunctions instruments
* Digilent Analog Discovery 2
